      <li><h4 id="brief">A brief history </h4>
        <p>Alexander Graham Bell applied for the patent in 1876. Westenr Union
        found it of no practical use and didn't purchase it. </p>
        <p>By 1877 he gut funding for the Bell Telephone Company and by 1878 the
        company was licensec to provide telephony in USA. </p>
        <p>In 1900 AT&amp;T became the parent company of the Bell System. AT&amp;T
        wanted to manage the long distance business of the Bell licencees. </p>
        <p>After Bell's patents expired in 1893 and 1894, numerous independent
        companies (over 6000) offered telephony services. Their networks were not
        interconnected, so users had to have different telephones for different
        purposes. </p>
        <p>This initialy shaped the networks. To communicate two telephones from
        two different Bell companies,additional long-distance facilities were
        required. This is the structure of the public switch telephone system
        (PSTN). </p>
        <p>Eventually AT&amp;T started purchasing independent companies to
        alleviate competition and increase revenue. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Kingsbury Commitment 
            <p>In 1913 the US DOJ brought a monopoly suit against AT&amp;T forcing
            it to stop purchasing smaller telcos. This Kingsbury Commitment
            provided: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>An arrengement to provide long distance to the independents, </li>
              <li>Bell's agreement to stop buying independent telcos, </li>
              <li>the end of the duplication of the telephone service, which
                finally brought</li>
              <li>the creation of the best national telecommunications facilities
                worldwide. </li>

        <p>MCI's is all digital. Signals are processed in order to place several in
        a wire (copper, coaxial, fiber optic or radio signal). </p>
        <p>Multiplexing: combining several signal in one is called
        <em>multiplexing</em>. </p>
        <p>One form of multiplexor "Channel Bank" takes several different signals

        <ul>
          <li>converts analog voice into a specific format of digital, </li>
          <li>formats all digital signals to a specific format, and</li>
          <li>combines all the digital signals into a single one. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><h4 id="Circuits">Circuits </h4>
        <p>The physical connection (or path) between two given points through with
        an electric current may be established. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>End-To-End circuit: A source device connecting to an alike
            destination device. For example one telephone reaching another to
            complete the circuit. Both process the same type of analog signal. </li>
          <li>Carrier circuit: A circuit that comines (multiplexes) several signals
            and moves then from one place to another. It is connected to other
            <em>carrier</em> circuits at junctions within the network. The
            <em>network</em> can be defined as local or long-distance. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><h4 id="Digital">Digital signals </h4>
        <p>Digital signals are those regarded as communicating <em>bits</em>. </p>
      </li>
      <li><h4 id="digital">The digital signal hierarchy </h4>
        <p>DS-0 (Digital Signal zer0-level) is the base circuit capacity, at 64,000
        bits per second. It is designed to carry a voice communication made of an
        eight-bit signal sampled 8,000 times per second, hence 8 x 8000 = 64000
        bandwidth. </p>
        <p>In the hierarchy, the combination of 24 DS-0s makes a DS-1 at 24 x 64000
        = 1,536,000 bps plus the framing bits giving 1,544,000bps. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) 
            <p>The multiplexer transmits 8 bits of each DS-0, when it reaches the
            last one it starts over with slot one. This happens 8000 times per
            second, the sampling frequency of each DS-0. A framing bit is added
            after each cycle, so the total bandwidth is 8000 + 1,536,000 bps. </p>
          </li>
          <li>Digital Signal One (DS-1) 
            <p>The DS-1 circuit is the first highway (or carrier circuit) onto the
            network. Is like a 24-lane highway if each DS-0 is a single road. </p>
            <p>TDM combines four DS-1 to make a DS-2 (not used) and seven DS-2 to
            make a DS-3 signal. A DS-3 can be made aldo of 28 DS-1s bypassing the
            Ds-2 level. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><h4 id="Aggregatin">Aggregating Bandwidth </h4>
        <p>A 256Kbps circuit can be made by aggregating 4 DS-0 channels. </p>
        <p>A DS-3 can be fractionalized in numbers of DS-1 channels. </p>
        <p>Often signals don't need to be regarded as channels, the user wants a
        single channel providing all the aggregate bandwith. </p>

        <p>A fiber optic cable is a core inside a cladding, both made of slightly
        different ultra-pure glass. </p>
        <p>These two layers are contained into a protective plastic coating,
        usually made of a soft cushion enclosed in a tougher outer layer. . </p>
        <p>Light pulses are injected in one tip of the cable using a laser or a
        LED. The light is totally reflected inside the core by the surface between
        the core and the cladding, in a way that allows the light signals to reach
        distances like 100 miles even if the cable to be bended. </p>
        <p>Light signals carry much more information than electrical signals
        because of the higher frequency of the light waves. </p>

        <p>It defines line rates known as Optical Carrier (OC) units. </p>
        <p>The OC-1 base rate provides 51.84Mbps, close to a DS-3 signal. IXC
        backbone netxorps operate at OC-48 or OC-192 speeds. OC-192 is a network
        line with transmission speeds of up to 9953.28 Mbit/s (payload: 9621.504
        Mbit/s; overhead: 331.776 Mbit/s). </p>

            <p>There are two types: </p>
            <p>Automatic Ringdown (ARD)</p>
            <p>The ARD operates when the telephone handset is picked up in one
            terminal ans causes a ring at the other one. </p>
            <p>Manual Ringdown</p>
            <p>In addition to picking the handset, the caller part has to press a
            button. These are common in the financial services industry and the
            military. </p>

          <li>DS-0 Analog Data 
            <p>The service supports frequencies in the range 300 ~ 3000Hz. Data
            transmission speeds range from 2.4 through 56Kbps, used for Internet

            <p>Analog data circuits can be used to connect faxes or modems at the
            customer's premises. </p>
            <p>Analog circuits come with 2 or 4 wires. A 4-wire circuit can
            transmit and receive at the same time. There are modems that can do
            duplex over 2-wire channels. </p>

            speed transmission. </p>
            <p>The key is end-to-end digital transmission. The result is maximun
            quality with a minimum of distortion. </p>
            <p>The most common application is a line between the customer system

      <dd>Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) is a regulatory term in telecommunications
      for the local telephone company. 
      <p>In the United States, wireline telephone companies are divided into
      two large categories: long distance (interexchange carrier, or IXCs) and
      local (local exchange carrier, or LECs). This structure is a result of
      1984 divestiture of then-regulated monopoly carrier American Telephone
      &amp; Telegraph. Local telephone companies at the time of the divestiture
      are also known as Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILEC). </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interexchange_carrier">IXC</a></dt>
      <dd>An Interexchange Carrier (IXC) is a U.S. legal and regulatory term for
      a telecommunications company, commonly called a long-distance telephone
      company, such as MCI (before its absorption by Verizon), Sprint and the
      former AT&amp;T (before its merger with SBC in 2005) in the United
      States. It is defined as any carrier that provides inter-LATA
      communication, where a LATA is a local access and transport area.

      <dd>The Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOC) are the result of United
      States v. AT&amp;T, the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust suit against
      the former American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (later known as
      AT&amp;T Corp.). </dd>
      <dd>AT&amp;T Corp.'s local operations were split into seven independent
      Regional Bell Operating Companies known as "Baby Bells". RBOCs were
      originally known as Regional Holding Companies (RHCs). Currently, three
      companies have the RBOCs as predecessors. They are "The New" AT&amp;T,
      Verizon, and CenturyLink. </dd>
      <dt>CO</dt>
      <dd>href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange"A central office
      (CO) is the physical building used to house inside plant equipment
      including telephone switches, which make telephone calls "work" in the
      sense of making connections and relaying the speech information. See
      <a>Telephone Exchange</a>. </dd>
      <dt>LATA</dt>
      <dd>Local access and transport area (LATA) is a term used in U.S.
      telecommunications regulation. It represents a geographical area of the
      United States under the terms of the Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ)
      that precipitated the breakup of the original AT&amp;T into the "Baby
      Bells". 
      <p>A LATA represents an area within which a divested Regional Bell
      operating company (<a href="#RBOC">RBOC</a>) is permitted to offer
      exchange telecommunications and exchange access services. Under the terms
      of the MFJ, the RBOCs are generally prohibited from providing services
      that originate in one LATA and terminate in another.</p>
      <p>LATA boundaries tend to be drawn around markets, and not necessarily
      along existing state, province, or even area code borders.</p>
      </dd>
      <dd>Local carriers make up various terms for "LATA", such as &ldquo;Service
      Area&rdquo; by Pacific Bell in California, or &ldquo;Regional Calling
      Area&rdquo; by Verizon in Maryland. </dd>
      <dt>CLEC</dt>
      <dd>A competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), in the United States, is a
      telecommunications provider company, sometimes called a "carrier")
      competing with other, already established carriers (generally the
      incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC). </dd>
      <dd>Local exchange carriers (LECs) are divided into incumbent (ILECs) and
      competitive (CLECs). The ILECs are usually the original, monopoly LEC in
      a given area, and receive different regulatory treatment from the newer
      CLECs. A data local exchange carrier (DLEC) is a CLEC specializing in DSL
      services by leasing lines from the ILEC and reselling them to Internet
      service providers (ISPs). </dd>

      <dt>LLU, LLUB</dt>
      <dd>Local loop unbundling (LLU or LLUB) is the regulatory process of
      allowing multiple telecommunications operators to use connections from
      the telephone exchange to the customer's premises. The physical wire
      connection between the local exchange and the customer is known as a
      "local loop", and is owned by the incumbent local exchange carrier (also
      referred to as the "ILEC", "local exchange", or in the United States
      either a "Baby Bell" or an independent telephone company). To increase
      competition, other providers are granted unbundled access. </dd>
      <dt id="DCS">DCS</dt>
      <dd>A digital cross-connect system (DCS or DXC) is a piece of
      circuit-switched network equipment, used in telecommunications networks,
      that allows lower-level TDM bit streams, such as DS0 bit streams, to be
      rearranged and interconnected among higher-level TDM signals, such as DS1
      bit streams. DCS units are available that operate on both older
      T-carrier/E-carrier bit streams, as well as newer SONET/SDH bit streams. 
      <p>DCS devices can be used for "grooming" telecommunications traffic,
      switching traffic from one circuit to another in the event of a network
      failure, supporting automated provisioning, and other applications.
      Having a DCS in a circuit-switched network provides important flexibility
      that can otherwise only be obtained at higher cost using manual "DSX"
      cross-connect patch panels. ?</p>

      <dt>TDM</dt>
      <dd>Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is a type of digital (or rarely
      analog) multiplexing in which two or more bit streams or signals are
      transferred apparently simultaneously as sub-channels in one
      communication channel, but are physically taking turns on the channel.
      The time domain is divided into several recurrent time slots of fixed
      length, one for each sub-channel. A sample byte or data block of
      sub-channel 1 is transmitted during time slot 1, sub-channel 2 during
      time slot 2, etc. One TDM frame consists of one time slot per sub-channel
      plus a synchronization channel and sometimes error correction channel
      before the synchronization. After the last sub-channel, error correction,
      and synchronization, the cycle starts all over again with a new frame,
      starting with the second sample, byte or data block from sub-channel 1,
      etc. </dd>
      <dt>PCM</dt>
      <dd>Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent
      sampled analog signals. It is the standard form for digital audio in
      computers and various Blu-ray, DVD and Compact Disc formats, as well as
      other uses such as digital telephone systems. A PCM stream is a digital
      representation of an analog signal, in which the magnitude of the analog
      signal is sampled regularly at uniform intervals, with each sample being
      quantized to the nearest value within a range of digital steps. 
      <p>PCM streams have two basic properties that determine their fidelity to
      the original analog signal: the sampling rate, which is the number of
      times per second that samples are taken; and the bit depth, which
      determines the number of possible digital values that each sample can
      take. </p>
      <p>DS-0 llines are designed after a signal sampled 8000 times per second
      at 8-bit deph = 64,000 bits per second. </p>
